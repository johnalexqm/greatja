Now that the data is clean, I can do analysis. I looked at the following: 
  1) Average, Mean, Mode per Year (2020-2023)
  2) Average, Mean, Mode per Month (2020-2023)
  3) Average, Mean, Mode per Day (2020-2023)
  4) Rideable Type (2020-2023)
  5) Trip Counts (2020-2023)

Each average, mean, and mode pertained to the ride_min_length column I created. That column measures how much time the trip took. I took out the outliers and any trip that was just 0. 

1) Average, Mean, Mode per Year (2020-2023) also splits the averages and maxes into casual and member rides, so I know the differences between the two rider types.

4) I was curious to how each rider type chose a bicycle. How many members rode an electric bike vs a docked bike? These are the questions I wanted to answer.

              COUNTIF(rideable_type = 'docked_bike') AS docked_bike_rides,
          --Then I see how many of those rides were done by a casual rider.

          )
          
          SELECT

I have the data I need to do a comparative analysis between member and casual riders now. I will use this data in my visualizations.
