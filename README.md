This repository stores all of the codes I used to query the data. 
It is a showcase of how far I've come as a data analyst. 

Before studying actual data analysis, I jumped right into learning SQL. 

Before SQL, I felt like a champion with Google Sheets - knowing how to format data, clean it, sort it, VLOOKUP, etc. But as datasets grow bigger, the slower Google Sheets can get. 
It was in this case study that I learned to appreciate SQL and what it has become for me as a tool in data analytics.
